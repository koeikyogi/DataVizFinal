    <h1>How Work Experience Shapes Resume Composition</h1>
    <p>Using NLP to reveal how work experience influences resume language.</p>
  </header>

    <section id="story">
    I was staring down a looming deadline— and my resume needed a complete overhaul, and every line felt like a blindspot. To regain control, I turned this project into a resume-optimization lab. First, I obtained a scraped set of diverse resumes and applied NLP to reveal the most effective structures, phrases, and metrics. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The site includes a variety of visualizations for different angles: a scatter plot showing sentiment versus experience, bar charts breaking down average sentiment and word count by experience bins, and multiple word clouds stacked to show category-specific term frequencies (technical skills, quantified metrics, action verbs, industry keywords). Together, these charts offer a comprehensive view of resume patterns derived from the scraped data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combined with the line chart's trend analysis, this suite of visualizations formed the backbone of my conclusion: they didn’t just reveal what to change, they showed when and why each tweak mattered. By transforming data into clear charts, this site guided me step-by-step through a focused, data-driven resume overhaul—ensuring every element is in its place for maximum impact in my resume.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong></p>
<p>
   In analyzing a collection of resumes across different experience levels using NLP and data visualization, I hypothesize that technical skills and quantified metrics will dominate early-career resumes—keeping overall sentiment neutral—while action-oriented leadership statements and a confident tone will become more prevalent as experience increases.

    <section id="sentiment-vs-experience" class="slide">
      <h2>Sentiment vs. Estimated Years of Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>This scatter plot displays every resume as a single point, positioned by its estimated years of experience (x-axis) and its overall sentiment score (y-axis). Larger circles indicate longer resumes (more words). You can see early-career resumes clustering near neutral sentiment, while mid- and late-career resumes trend toward more positive language. The marker sizes also show that the most detailed resumes tend to carry stronger sentiment.</p>
      </ul>

      <div class="text-block">
        <h3>Insights from the Scatter Plot</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Most resumes cluster under 5 years of experience, with sentiment scores between 0.01 and 0.05—indicating a balanced, factual tone in early-career resumes.</li>
            <li>A few outliers reach sentiment near 0.09, showing that even brief resumes can adopt a notably positive voice.</li>
            <li>Mid-career resumes (6–10 years) exhibit the widest sentiment range (0.005–0.07), reflecting varied personal narratives at that stage.</li>
            <li>Senior resumes (15+ years) return to near-neutral sentiment (around 0.00), suggesting a more reserved, professional tone in veteran-level resumes.</li>

    <section id="avg-sentiment-by-bin" class="slide">
      <h2>Average Sentiment by Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>This bar chart breaks down average sentiment scores into four experience groups (0–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16+ years). Taller bars mean more positive tone on average. Here, you’ll notice that sentiment steadily rises through the first three bins and then levels off, suggesting that early-career professionals use the most upbeat language in their resumes.</p>
      </ul>

      <div class="text-block">
        <h3>Bin-Based Sentiment Insights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>0–5 yrs:</strong> Average sentiment ≈ 0.020 – a slightly positive, balanced tone in entry‐level resumes.</li>
            <li><strong>6–10 yrs:</strong> Average sentiment ≈ 0.0198 – nearly the same, indicating mid‐career resumes maintain a steady neutral-positive tone.</li>
            <li><strong>11–15 yrs:</strong> Average sentiment ≈ 0.0187 – the lowest of the four bins, suggesting more reserved phrasing emerges in mid-career documents.</li>
            <li><strong>16+ yrs:</strong> Average sentiment ≈ 0.0192 – a modest rebound, reflecting a professional but still positive tone in senior-level resumes.</li>

      <h2>Trend of Average Sentiment Across Experience</h2>
      <ul>
      <p>In this line chart, each point represents the average sentiment for one experience bin, connected to reveal the overall pattern. The downward slope from 0–5 to around 12 and half years highlights growing confidence in mid-career resumes, with a slight plateau or dip afterward.</p>

            <li><strong>6–10 yrs:</strong> Avg sentiment ≈ 0.01977 — a slight dip, but still a generally positive framing.</li>
            <li><strong>11–15 yrs:</strong> Avg sentiment ≈ 0.01875 — the lowest point, indicating a more measured, reserved tone.</li>

        <p>This bar chart shows mean resume length for each experience category. You’ll see that early-stage resumes hover around 200 words, grow to about 300 words in mid-career, and then taper off slightly with seniority. It illustrates how verbosity tends to increase with experience before streamlining at senior levels.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This site transformed my resume overhaul from guesswork into a systematic, data-driven process. By visualizing term frequencies over time, comparing word clouds, and binning vocabulary by experience, I uncovered exactly which words to emphasize and which to prune. Those charts didn’t just display numbers—they guided every edit, helping me craft a resume that speaks the language recruiters actually use. In the end, I moved from reactive tweaks to proactive strategy, ensuring my resume conveys impact, precision, and confidence at every level.
